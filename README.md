# Welcome to Spikehub!

Spikehub is a website ([https://thespikehub.com](https://thespikehub.com)) that aggregates information about roundnet tournaments into one place, so tournament directors can get more eyes on their tournaments and players can find and register for upcoming tournaments, see information about past tournaments, and follow along with events that are currently happening!

2. **In the terminal, install dependencies and start local server:**
    npm install
    npm run start
3. **Open http://localhost:3000 to check out your local version of the site**
